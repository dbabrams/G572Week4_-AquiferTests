Assuming the initial pre-pumping water table configuration is a flat level surface, the groundwater flow gradient from the brine contamination zone towards the well will be a function of the drawdown created by the well. Calculate the drawdown at 1 ft intervals from the well to the edge of the brine zone (starting at r = 1' and ending at r = 5200').  Approximate the travel time by calculating the linear groundwater velocity (v) for each of the segments. Porosity is 20%.\n",
