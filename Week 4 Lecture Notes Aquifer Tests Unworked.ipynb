        "In late 1980s the Village of Okawville, Illinois experienced a large increase in the concentrations of chloride, hardness, and sulfate in supply well `#4`, one of two principal supply wells for the community. A subsequent investigation found that the aquifer was contaminated by brines spilled at the surface from oil drilling operations.  A resistivity survey was conducted by the Illinois State Geological Survey to determine the extent of the brine contamination.  The village wells are constructed in an alluvial sand aquifer that occupies the flood plain of modern Kaskaskia River valley. The existing wells are 500 feet from the valley wall which acts as a flow barrier.\n",
